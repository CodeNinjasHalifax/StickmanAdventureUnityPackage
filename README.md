Sukhbir, a determined 13-year-old, embarked on a two-year journey at Code Ninjas to bring his imagination to life through game development. With unwavering passion, he crafted a platform shooter where a stranded stickman battles the formidable "chads" on an alien world to retrieve his scattered rocketship pieces. Through countless hours of coding and creativity, Sukhbir culminated his adventure with an epic showdown against "Giga Chad" to secure the final piece to escape the extraterrestrial realm.
